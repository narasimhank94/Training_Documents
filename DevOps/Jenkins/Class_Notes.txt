Build Orchestration using Jenkins ::::

	Introduction to Jenkins ::::
	
	What is Jenkins :::
	
		Jenkins is Open-Source Build Orchestration Tool.
		Used to Automate the End-to-End Application Build and Deployments
		Using Jenkins we can create CI/CD Pipelines 
		
	Jenkins Architecture ::
	
		Jenkins is based on Master-Slave Architecture :::
		
			Jenkins_Master (VM)				==> Install Jenkins - To Create Jenkins CI/CD Pipeline Jobs/Projects
				
				Jenkins_SlaveNode1 (VM)		==> Perform Application Builds - compile/create artifacts
						
	
		At Enterprise level :::
		
			Java Applications 
			.Net Applications
			Python Applications 

		Scenario1 :	Application Build and Release frequency is very less.
		
			Jenkins_Master (VM) 	==> Create Jenkins CI/CD Pipeline Projects & Execute the Build in same Jenkins_Master Node.
			
			
		Scenario2 : Muliple Applications with high Build and Release frequencies.
			
			Jenkins_Master (VM)			==> To Create Jenkins CI/CD Pipeline Projects and schedule to the builds in the slave_nodes
																	
				Jenkins_SlaveNode1 (VM)	==> Perform Application Builds - Java Applications 
				Jenkins_SlaveNode2 (VM)	==> Perform Application Builds - .Net Applications			
				Jenkins_SlaveNode3 (VM)	==> Perform Application Builds - Python Applications 
				Jenkins_SlaveNode4 (VM)	==> Perform Application Builds - Angular/NodeJS
				Jenkins_SlaveNode5 (VM)	==> Perform Application Builds - Ruby 	



	- Need to Set-up the Build Environment for Java Maven Applications :::
	
		1. Create a Linux Script to Set-up the Build Environment for Java Maven Applications
		
		2. Create Linux User with ssh keys to perform Application Builds 
		
		3. Perform regular clean-up of the workspace dir
