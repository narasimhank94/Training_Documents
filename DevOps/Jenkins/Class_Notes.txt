Build Orchestration using Jenkins ::::

	https://github.com/PL-DevOps-GenAI-A1125/java-webapp-project
	
	Introduction to Jenkins ::::
	
	What is Jenkins :::
	
		Jenkins is Open-Source Build Orchestration Tool.
		Used to Automate the End-to-End Application Build and Deployments
		Using Jenkins we can create CI/CD Pipelines 
		
	Jenkins Architecture ::
	
		Jenkins is based on Master-Slave Architecture :::
		
			Jenkins_Master (VM)				==> Install Jenkins - To Create Jenkins CI/CD Pipeline Jobs/Projects
				
				Jenkins_SlaveNode1 (VM)		==> Perform Application Builds - compile/create artifacts
						
	
		At Enterprise level :::
		
			Java Applications 
			.Net Applications
			Python Applications 

		Scenario1 :	Application Build and Release frequency is very less.
		
			Jenkins_Master (VM) 	==> Create Jenkins CI/CD Pipeline Projects & Execute the Build in same Jenkins_Master Node.
			
			
		Scenario2 : Muliple Applications with high Build and Release frequencies.
			
			Jenkins_Master (VM)			==> To Create Jenkins CI/CD Pipeline Projects and schedule to the builds in the slave_nodes
																	
				Jenkins_SlaveNode1 (VM)	==> Perform Application Builds - Java Applications 
				Jenkins_SlaveNode2 (VM)	==> Perform Application Builds - .Net Applications			
				Jenkins_SlaveNode3 (VM)	==> Perform Application Builds - Python Applications 
				Jenkins_SlaveNode4 (VM)	==> Perform Application Builds - Angular/NodeJS
				Jenkins_SlaveNode5 (VM)	==> Perform Application Builds - Ruby 	



	- Need to Set-up the Build Environment for Java Maven Applications :::
	
		1. Create a Linux Script to Set-up the Build Environment for Java Maven Applications
		
		2. Create Linux User with ssh keys to perform Application Builds 
		
		3. Perform regular clean-up of the workspace dir

	Working with Jenkins :::
	
	- Jenkins Pipelines/Jobs/Projects Workflow :
		
				- Application Build 
					==> Process of Compiling the Source Code, 
						Create the Artifacts(Executable code - Binaries - *.war/*.jar/*.exec/*.dll) 
				- Unit Test 
				- Promote the Changes to Test Environments
				- Notify the Testing Team thru Emails	
				
	CI/CD Workflow :::
	
		SCM_Checkout 
		Application Build 
		Unit Testing 
		Create Artifacts 
		Promote the Application to Test Environments
		Notify 
		Deploy to Prod 	
		
	
	- Developers' Perspectives :
	
		- Developers are just the consumers of Jenkins using Jenkins Tools and Services.
		- Developers use Jenkins to execute/cancel/view the output - workspace of the Jenkins projects/Pipelines/Jobs.
		
	- DevOps Perspectives:
		
		- DevOps Team is the owner of Jenkins.		
		
		- Roles & Responsibilities of DevOps Team/Resources :
		
		- Jenkins Administration :
		
			- Installation & Configuration of Jenkins 
			- Jenkins Global System Configuration 
			- Plugins Management 
			- Tools Management 
			- User Management
			- Security Management 
			- Credentials Management 
			- Create the Jenkins Master & Slave Node Configurations 
			- Create CICD Pipeline Projects to automate the Applications build  and deployments
			- Onboard Applications to DevOps Practice
			- Periodic Backup & Recovery
			- Periodic Upgrade of Jenkins Services and Plugins 
			- Trobleshoot any Jenkins related Issues
			
	
	- Installation & Configuration of Jenkins :::
	
		Jenkins runs as a service
		
		Jenkins used the default port: 8080
		
		- Login to AWS Console 
		
		- Launch AWS EC2 Ubuntu Instance - 22.04v AMI	/ t2.micro 
		
		- Install Jenkins.
		
			- Jenkins Package run as a service using default port 8080
				- It can be execute using Web-Browser	
		
		
		- https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/installing/
		
		- https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/installing/linux/
		
		- Jenkins Installation --> 
					
		- To Install any tool/package :
		
			Install Pre-requisites	
			Install Actual Tool
			Post Installation Actions				
				
					Install Pre-requisites			===> jdk 
					
					Install Actual Tool				===> Install Jenkins  
					
					Post Installation Actions		===> Start Jenkins & Setup Jenkins Service.		
			
	
	- Global System Configurations :
		
		==> Is used to Configure the default properties/External Services/Servers in Jenkins.
		--> goto manage jenkins -> Choose System Config
		
	
	- Plugins Management :
		==> Manage Plugins - Enable/Disable/Install/Uninstall/Update 
		--> goto manage jenkins -> Choose Plugins

	
	- Tools Management :
		==> Manage the Dev/Build Tools for Jenkins
