1. if connecting to SSH client takes time and bcoz of that connection gets terminated: ERROR - Network Error: Software caused connection abort
--> in MobaXterm.ini file, add below
[MottyOptions]
PingInterval=0
PingIntervalSecs=300
--> second option is to increase the keepalive option in Connections tab in Putty to 300 and select the second option and save the session

-->third option is to change reg key value from 5 to 10
in command prompt:
reg add "HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Tcpip\Parameters" /v TcpMaxDataRetransmissions /t REG_DWORD /d 16 /f
then verify the value with
reg query "HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Tcpip\Parameters" /v TcpMaxDataRetransmissions

--> fourth option is to set the auto-tuning value to disable and prevent heuristics from changing it
in command prompt:
netsh int tcp set global autotuninglevel=disabled
netsh int tcp set heuristics disabled
then verify the value with
netsh int tcp show global

the above options extend the connection time and retries multiple times before giving up on a SSH server

2. ERROR - Connection timeout (in MobaXterm)

When the error changed from 1 to 2. this is because
--> allow ssh.exe, mobaxterm.exe paths to windows firewall
--> add a new outgoing rule in firewall -> TCP port 22 allow
Remote side unexpectedly closed network connection
