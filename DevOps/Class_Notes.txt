	What is DevOps ?
	
	
	IT Service: 
	
	Software Applications :::
	
		- Web Applications
		
		- Desktops Applications
		
		- Mobile Applications
	
		- Embedded Applications 
	
	
	
	Software Development Life Cycle :
	
		- Requirement Analysis 
		
		- Design & Documentation 
		
		- Code & Development 
		
		- Testing 
		
		- Implemented to Production 
		
		- Monitor & Maintain
	
				
	Waterfall Model: 
	
		- Linear in fashion
		- It strictly follows top-down approach
		- It is meant only for Monolith Application Architecture
		

				- Desktops Applications ::

	Iteration 1: Inventory Management

		- Requirement Analysis 
		
		- Design & Documentation 
		
		- Code & Development 
		
		- Testing 
		
		- Implemented to Production with proper approval
		
		- Monitor & Maintain	
	
	
	Iteration 2: User Interface Design

		- Monitor & Maintain
		

	Iteration nth : Online Payment

		- Requirement Analysis 
		
		- Design & Documentation 
		
		- Code & Development 
		
		- Testing 
		
		- Implemented to Production with proper approval
		
		- Monitor & Maintain
		
	
	Using AGILE Methodologies:
	
		- We can achieve:
		
			- Continuous Development
			
			- Continuous Integration 
			
			- Continuous Testing 
			
			- Continuous Delivery 
			
				- It expect Manual Approval to release the changes to Production Environment.
			
			
		- We cannot achieve: 
		
			- Continuous Deployment 
				
				- It Never expect any Manual Approval to release the changes to Production Environment.
			
			
				
	- DevOps ::::
	
		DevOps is Software Development Strategy, which promote Collaboration between the Teams like Development Team and Operations Team to achieve Continuous Development, Continuous Integration, Continuous Testing, Continuous Delivery, Continuous Deployment and Continuous Monitoring in more automated fashion.
		
	
	How to Implement DevOps ?
	
		- Identify the Teams involved in overall SDLC Process :
		
			- DevOps Team 
				- Infra-Structure Management Team 
				- Application Development Team 
				- Testing Team 						50 Test Servers - 			
				- Release Management Team 
				- Production Support Team 
				- Production Monitoring Team 
				- IT Security Team 
				
		
		- Environments :
		
			Non-Prod Environments 											Production Environments			
			
				- Dev Environment
				
				- Test Environments 
				
					- QA Environment 
						Quality Assurance
					
					- UAT Environment		======================>				Production Servers (LIVE Environment)
						User Acceptance Testing 
					
					Eg.: 
					Telecomm Services :
					
						- New Offer 
						
						- Walk-in to nearest outlet 
						
						
		- Application Architecture :
		
			- Monolith Application Architecture
				- These are Tightly-Coupled Application Architecture
				- All the dependencies and functions are tighly coupled.
				- We cannot achieve Continuous Deployment. Only Continuous Delivery is possible.
			
			
			- Micro-Service Based Application Architecture
				- These are loosely Coupled Application Architecture
				- Each and every function is considered as a Micro-Service
				- Each Micro-Service will be independently Developed and Deployed to Production
				- Using Micro-Service Application Architecture only we can achieve Continuous Deployment.

 Introduction ::::
 
 Scripting Languages :
	
		shell,groovy,python,yaml Scripts
 
	
 
 What is DevOps ?
 
	- Is a Software Development Strategy.
	- Used to promote the collaboration between the Development Team and Operations Team
	
	
	Software Applications :
	
		Web Application/Mobile Application/Desktop Application/Embedded Application
	
	
	
	SDLC :
		Software Development Life Cycle 
		
		- Requirement Analysis 
		
		- Design & Documentation 
		
		- Code & Develop
		
		- Test 
		
		- Implement to Production(LIVE)
		
		- Monitor/Maintain
	
		

	- Waterfall Model 			Legacy Applications
	
		- Linear in fashion
		- It strictly follows top-down approach
		- It is meant only for Monolith Application Architecture
		- Parallel Development is not possible
		

	Whole Application1:
	
		- Requirement Analysis 
		
		- Design & Documentation 
		
		- Code & Develop
		
		- Test 
		
		- Implement to Production(LIVE)
		
		- Monitor/Maintain


		
	- AGILE Methodologies ==> Task based approach!
	
		- To bring Agility to the SDLC Process 
		- To perform Parallel Development
		- Agile Methodologies using Iterations develop the product 
		
		- Iterations are the functions/Modules 
		
		- Each Iteration can be independently developed, tested and released to Production Environment with proper approvals
		
		
	Iteration 1 - Work with Function1
	
		- Requirement Analysis 
		
		- Design & Documentation 
		
		- Code & Develop
		
		- Test 
		
		- Implement to Production with proper Manual approvals
		
		- Monitor/Maintain	
		

	Iteration 2 - Work with Function2
	
		- Requirement Analysis 
		
		- Design & Documentation 
		
		- Code & Develop
		
		- Test 
		
		- Implement to Production with proper Manual approvals
		
		- Monitor/Maintain
		
	'n' no. of Iterations 
	
		- Requirement Analysis 
		
		- Design & Documentation 
		
		- Code & Develop
		
		- Test 
		
		- Implement to Production with proper Manual approvals
		
		- Monitor/Maintain		
		
		Using AGILE Methodologies,

		- We can achieve:
		
			- Continuous Development
			
			- Continuous Integration 
			
			- Continuous Testing 
			
			- Continuous Delivery 
			
				- It expect Manual Approval to release the changes to Production Environment.
			
			
		- We cannot achieve: 
		
			- Continuous Deployment 
				
				- It Never expect any Manual Approval to release the changes to Production Environment.

	How to Implement DevOps ?
	
		- Identify the Teams involved in overall SDLC Process :
		
			- DevOps Team 
				- Infra-Structure Management Team - Resource Provisioning & Configurations
				- Application Development Team 
				- Testing Team 						
				- Release Management Team 
				- Production Support Team 
				- Production Monitoring Team

	- DevOps Stages:

		- Continuous Development :::
		
			- Is capability of any Application Development Team to Continuously Develop the Code.
			- It is a process that improves the Developers' Productivity*****
			
				- Role of Developer :::
					
					- Understand the Design 
					
					- Create the Source Code --> Java Programs
					
					Manual Activities :
					
						- Application Build 
							==> Process of Compiling the Source Code, 
								Create the Artifacts(Executable code - Binaries - *.war/*.jar/*.exec/*.dll) 
						- Unit Test 
						- Promote the Changes to Test Environments
						- Notify the Testing Team thru Emails
				
					Using DevOps Approach :
					
						Automate:
						
							- Application Build 
								==> Process of Compiling the Source Code, 
									Create the Artifacts(Executable code - Binaries - *.war/*.jar/*.exec/*.dll) 
							- Unit Test 
							- Promote the Changes to Test Environments
							- Notify the Testing Team thru Emails

						Developers; 
						
							- Create the Source Code
							- Save/Commit the Source Code in the Source Code Repositories. 						

				Tools :
				
					- IDE - Integrated Development Environment - Eclipse,Visual Studio, Pycharm, Visual Studio Code.
					- Git,Github 
		
		
		
		- Continuous Integration
		- Continuous Testing
		- Continuous Delivery & Deployment
		- Continuous Monitoring
