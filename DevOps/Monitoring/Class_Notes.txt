	Monitoring Tools :::
	
		- Prometheus & Grafana 
		
	Monitoring Tools Architecture:
	
	Capabilities of Monitoring Tools:
	
	Setup the Prometheus and Grafana Monitor Server:
		
		
	- Continuous Monitoring :::
	
		- Used Monitor the End-to-End Infra-Structure to ensue High Availability of the Infra-Structure & Application
		
		- Threshold Limit: 
		
			- 75% CPU 
			
			- 80% RAM 
			
			- Set Alarm 	
	
	- Monitoring Tools :::
		
			Infra-Structure Monitoring :
			
				-	Prometheus/Grafana/Splunk/Dynatrace/Nagios
			
			Application Monitoring :
			
				-	DataDog/AppDynamics 
	
			
			AWS :	AWS CloudWatch 
			
		
		
		- Prometheus 	==> Infra-Structure Monitoring Tool 
							Prometheus is considered as a Data Source to Grafana 
							
		- Grafana 		==> Visualization Tool 
							Grafana uses the monitoring metrics from Prometheus and Prepare Monitoring Dashboards
							
							
	-	Architecture of Monitoring Tools:	

		- Based on Client Server Architecture
		- Based on Agents 
		
		- Produc Monitoring Team ::::
		
	
	- Setup the Prometheus and Grafana Monitor Server:		
	
		Time Series DataBase - used to maintain the monitoring metrics
		
		PromQL Expressions/Queries to query the data from Time Series Database
		
		
	- Prepare Monitoring Dashboards ::::	
	
		- Integrate Prometheus & Grafana :::
		
		- Create Monitoring Dashboards ::::
